description: |
  Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game similar to the classic
  Escape Velocity series. Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading,
  carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a
  better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow
  up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope
  to find friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own.
